        <p> Hello! My name is Emma, feel free to call me Em. By day, I am a Front Desk Agent. I smile and make visits to Tucson memorable for everyone I enteract with. By night, I am Mom to 3 amazing boys. We enjoy dance parties (the Cha Cha slide is our jam), junk food and movie night, all day outings to the park and working in the garden.</p>
        <p>I have worked in Hospitality for 10+ years with a brief pause during a move to Oregon. I started in Housekeeping at the Tanque Verde Ranch in 2007. Shortly after starting I met my husband and we married in 2009. Shortly after, we welcomed our 2nd son in 2010 and moved to Portland Oregon. I found a new obsession in Scrapbooking and wound up working at Michael's as their Scrapbooking Instructor throughout most of our time in Portland. We returned to Tucson late 2011 and I continued working for Michael's while my husband went back to the Ranch.</p>
